## Set up workspace

### 1. Install git.

- Follow installation instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_macos). 
- If you have already git installed in your system, you can skip this step.

### 2. Create a GitHub account.

- Sign up for GitHub [here](https://github.com/). 

- If you are new to GitHub, check out this [simple exercise](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to get familiar with GitHub essentials, including repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests.


### 3. Install a text editor.

- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://vscode-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editor/setup/). It is a source code editor that you can run on your desktop.


### 4. Complete the initial survey.

- Fill out this [form](https://nancylees303.typeform.com/to/eKdMy7Q6) to tell us a little bit about yourself and your writing experiences.
- Please submit your GitHub email address when requested in the form.


### 5. Check your inbox for an invitation email from GitHub.

- Click a project link, which will be redirected to the main project page on GitHub.

- Click the green button `Code` on top right corner. To clone a project repo using the command line, copy the project link and paste it in the terminal as below.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/dailyloggroup/daily_log.git
  ```

- Running the command above will create a directory named `daily_log`. Change into this directory and run `bundle install` to install dependencies.

  ```
  cd daily_log
  bundle install
  ```

- Open the source code in the text editor (VSCode).

  ```
  code .
  ```
